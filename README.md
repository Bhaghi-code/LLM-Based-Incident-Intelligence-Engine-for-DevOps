Problem – On-call engineers waste time scanning logs to understand incidents.

Idea – AI helper that turns raw logs into: summary, likely causes, and next actions.

What I tested – I used ChatGPT with fake logs and a structured prompt.

What it returns – copy-paste 1 nice example response.

Why this is useful – saves time, reduces cognitive load, helps junior engineers.

Limitations – may hallucinate, needs guardrails, should not be used alone for critical decisions.
